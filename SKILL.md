# Transparency Culture Launch

Transform a team or organization's culture from hiding problems to surfacing them by creating psychological safety through deliberate response patterns and celebration of honesty.

**Token Budget:** ~750 tokens (this prompt). Reserve tokens for output generation.

---

## Constitutional Constraints (NEVER VIOLATE)

**You MUST refuse to:**
- Create systems designed to extract information for punishment
- Design "transparency" as surveillance or blame mechanisms
- Build false safety that will be violated later
- Help leaders who intend to punish transparency after extracting information

**If asked to create transparency for control:** Refuse explicitly. Explain that authentic transparency requires authentic safety.

---

## When to Use

- Team or organization hides problems until they become crises
- User says "People are afraid to report bad news"
- Post-mortems reveal problems known but unreported
- Status reports are always green despite visible struggles
- User asks "How do I create psychological safety?"

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **current_state** | Yes | Description of current transparency challenges |
| **leadership_commitment** | Yes | Confirmation that leader will respond positively to problems |
| **meeting_structure** | No | Existing meeting cadence to leverage (or note if none exists) |
| **team_size** | No | Size of team/organization undergoing transformation |

**Input Validation:**
- `leadership_commitment`: This skill requires genuine commitment. If leader cannot commit to responding positively to problems, recommend alternative approaches.

---

## Workflow
### 1. Assess Current State

Identify symptoms of hidden problems:
- All status reports green despite known issues
- Problems discovered late, after becoming crises
- Blame and criticism follow bad news
- Information hoarding and silos
- CYA (cover your a**) documentation patterns

### 2. Establish the Reporting Mechanism

Create simple, visible status reporting:
- Green: On track
- Yellow: At risk, have a plan
- Red: Off plan, need help

**Key message to communicate:** "Red is the best color because it means we can help."

### 3. Prepare the Leader Response

Script the exact response to the first red:

### Step 1: "Thank you for the transparency."



### Step 2: "That takes courage, and it's exactly how we get better."



### Step 3: "Now, who can help?"



### Step 4: Mobilize resources to address the problem



### Step 5: Publicly celebrate the transparency (not the problem, the honesty)



**Critical:** The response must be identical every time. Consistency builds trust.

### 4. Launch and Wait

- Introduce the status reporting system
- In early meetings, everything will likely be green
- Do not force reds; wait for organic surfacing
- Maintain positive, open demeanor

### 5. Celebrate the First Red

When someone finally reports a red:

### Step 1: Respond immediately with gratitude (not relief, not surprise)



### Step 2: Ask "Who can help?" before analyzing the problem



### Step 3: Mobilize help publicly



### Step 4: After the meeting, acknowledge the courage privately



### Step 5: Tell the story to others (with permission) as a positive example



### 6. Watch Safety Spread

After the first red is celebrated:
- Expect more honest reporting in the next meeting
- Each positive response reinforces safety
- Within 2-4 cycles, culture begins shifting
- Measure by ratio of colors (healthy teams have reds and yellows)

### 7. Sustain and Reinforce

- Never violate the response pattern, ever
- Tell stories of successful transparency
- Measure cultural health by willingness to report reds
- Address any leaders who punish transparency immediately

## Outputs

### Transparency Culture Launch Plan

```markdown
# Transparency Culture Transformation: [Team/Organization Name]

## Current State Assessment

**Symptoms identified:**
- [List current transparency challenges]

**Root causes:**
- [Historical punishment patterns]
- [Information as power dynamics]
- [Blame culture indicators]

## The Reporting Mechanism

| Color | Definition | Expected Response |
|-------|------------|-------------------|
| Green | On track | "Great, what's next?" |
| Yellow | At risk, have plan | "Good visibility. What support do you need?" |
| Red | Need help | "Thank you for the transparency. Who can help?" |

## Leader Response Scripts

### When someone reports Yellow:
"Good visibility. It sounds like you have a plan. What support do you need from the team?"

### When someone reports Red:
"Thank you for the transparency. That takes courage, and it's exactly how we get better. Now, who can help? [Turn to team] Who has experience with this? Who has capacity?"

### After addressing the Red:
"I want to acknowledge [Name]'s transparency. This is exactly how we work together. When we surface problems early, we can solve them together."

## Launch Sequence

**Week 1:**
- Introduce color-coded status reporting
- Explain the new response pattern
- State explicitly: "Red is the best color because it means we can help"

**Weeks 2-4:**
- Maintain positive, open demeanor in meetings
- Do not force reds; wait for organic surfacing
- Respond consistently to any hint of honesty

**First Red Event:**
- Execute response script exactly
- Celebrate publicly
- Reinforce privately

**Ongoing:**
- Never violate response pattern
- Tell success stories
- Measure color ratios

## Success Metrics

| Metric | Baseline | Target |
|--------|----------|--------|
| Status reports with Yellow/Red | [X]% | >30% |
| Problems discovered before crisis | [X]% | >80% |
| Time from problem awareness to escalation | [X] days | <1 week |
| Team trust survey scores | [X] | +20% |

## Warning Signs (Requiring Intervention)

- Any leader punishes transparency
- Status reports revert to all-green
- Problems still discovered late
- Team members reporting different status privately vs. publicly

## Sustainability Rules

1. Response pattern is sacred; never violate it
2. Any violation requires immediate acknowledgment and recommitment
3. New team members get explicit onboarding on transparency culture
4. Stories of successful transparency are told regularly
```

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Leader cannot commit to positive response | Do not proceed; explain why commitment is prerequisite |
| No existing meeting structure | Recommend establishing BPR first, then launch transparency culture |
| Organization has history of betrayed trust | Acknowledge difficulty; recommend longer timeline with smaller wins |
| First red is punished | Crisis response: leader must publicly acknowledge error and recommit |
| Progress stalls after initial gains | Diagnose: likely inconsistent responses somewhere in org |

---

## Constraints

- Do not use this analysis as the sole basis for critical decisions
- Do not apply this framework to situations outside its intended scope
- Acknowledge that analysis is based on available data, which may be incomplete
- Honor the complexity of real-world situations that resist simple categorization
- Present findings with appropriate confidence levels
- Recognize the limits of the methodology

## Example

**Input:**
```
current_state: "Our engineering team's standups are always green even though we
              regularly miss sprint commitments. People only mention problems
              after they've already caused delays."
leadership_commitment: "Yes, I commit to responding positively. I've never
                       punished bad news intentionally, but I realize my
                       frustrated reactions may have created fear."
meeting_structure: "Daily standups, weekly retrospectives"
team_size: 8 engineers
```

**Output:** [Complete launch plan with assessment, response scripts tailored to engineering context, week-by-week launch sequence, and specific metrics like sprint completion predictability]

## Integration

This skill integrates with:
- **business-plan-review-design** - Provides meeting structure for transparency to occur
- **alignment-check** - Transparency reveals misalignment; alignment-check diagnoses it
- **expected-behaviors-design** - "Communicate candidly" should be an expected behavior
